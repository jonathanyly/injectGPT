InjectGPT is a Chrome extension that injects a **custom system prompt**, **developer prompt**, and **model selection** directly into ChatGPT requests.

Once configured, it **always uses your chosen settings** for every conversation.

For example, you can define a new system prompt and ChatGPT will permanently behave according to it.

---

## How It Works

The extension intercepts all `/conversation` requests at the **network level**, replacing the **model**, **system prompt**, and **developer prompt** with your current settings *before* they reach OpenAI’s servers.

---

## Features

- **Model selection** – switch between `gpt-5-2`, `gpt-5-2-thinking`, and other models  
- **Custom system prompt** – define how the AI behaves  
- **Custom developer prompt** – inject additional instructions after user messages  
- **Settings persistence** – preferences are saved in `localStorage`
